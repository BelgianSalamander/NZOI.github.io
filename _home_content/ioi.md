The [IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)](http://ioinformatics.org/) is the foremost high school programming contest in the world. Each year, around August, it is hosted by a different country. New Zealand first sent a team in 2006, to the 18th Olympiad.

We choose 4 students to represent New Zealand at the IOI each year. As well as their informatics ability, we look for students with passion, motivation and travelability. Despite the IOI being an individual contest, we value teamwork since students will be travelling, training, and representing NZ together as a team. Students are selected from our January Camp and expected to compete in various contests and training events throughout the year. Many of our past students are now working for certain search bar companies.
