NZOI is the New Zealand Olympiad in Informatics, one of a number of Secondary School Olympiads operating under the umbrella organisation known as, NZ Science Olympiads.

In 2011 computer science achievement standards were introduced into high schools. While the high school computer science curriculum is a great improvement on the old curriculum. NZOI provides an opportunity for students excited by computer science and programming at high school to come together and improve their abilities beyond what is offered at high school while meeting like minded students passionate about the topic.

The NZOI's goals are to:

- Provide training opportunities in Informatics to selected New Zealand students who are currently enrolled in a secondary school in New Zealand, or have been enrolled in the last 8 months.
- To select students for the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI).
- To foster informatics and programming in high schools across New Zealand.
