Every year in January, we hold an informatics training camp for high school students (and some teachers).
The primary purpose of our training camp is to train students towards representing New Zealand in the International Olympiad in Informatics.

Camp has streamed groups all the way from new programmers to experienced competitors. Beginners are introduced to programming in C++ while more experienced students learn about algorithms and university level computer science concepts. Students receive talks from leading university lecturers as well and guidance from ex-NZOI students. During and after camp a number of contests are held for the students to allow them the opportunity to show us their skills and compete to be selected for the Olympiad squad.

Many students have also found that they really enjoy socialising with like-minded students. Additionally some of our past students have found Universities willing to let them skip papers, because of their NZOI experience.
