## About Us

The NZIC is being run by the New Zealand Olympiad in Informatics (NZOI) organisation.

The NZIC is just a small taste of what it's all about. Hopefully we spark your interest and can encorage you to join us at one of our January camps!

Each year, we run the January camp to teach students about programming and algorithms. During the camp, two contests are held. After camp, students continue to train and participate in selection contests. Around late March, 4 students will be picked to form a team to represent New Zealand at the International Olympiad in Informatics.

The NZIC has been set up to introduce new students to competitive programming, algorithms and problem solving. The first two problems each round are designed to be approachable to new students, and encourage them to learn more about informatics. The remaining problems are designed to be progressively more difficult, so that students can aim to work up through the problems as they improve.
