## Registration

**Official registration for Round 1 is open!** Please follow the instructions below.

The contest will be free this year. We may consider adding a small registration fee in future years.

### Official contestants

To register as an official contestant, all students at a school will be supervised, and compete at the same time. Each school will assign a contact person who may nominate any time from Tuesday to Saturday of that round.

The supervisor may be a teacher, volunteering parent or a trusted non-competing senior student (school prefect recommended by a teacher).

Please make sure to register at least 1 week before the contest starts, as late registrations may not be accepted in time.

#### For students

Before registering, please create an account on our [training site](https://train.nzoi.org.nz). To compete in the contest, make sure to fill a first and last name, as well as details of your school and expected school graduation date. Let your supervisor/teacher know your username and get them to follow the instructions below.

At least 1 week before the contest starts, we will set up a practice contest so that you can familiarise yourself with the user interface. The startcode is practice.

To check that you have been properly registered, make sure you can see the Start buttons in both the practice and the official contest (grayed out).

#### For the supervisor or contact person

Please register your interest as soon as possible. First, create an account on our [training site](https://train.nzoi.org.nz). Then email [nzic@nzoi.org.nz](mailto:nzic@nzoi.org.nz) with the following information:

- Your name
- Your school
- The expected time you will supervise the contest at your school.

After you have registered, you will be given permission to add students through our web interface. To do this:

1. go to the contest page
2. click the contestants tab
3. find the usernames of the students that will sit the contest, and click register

If they do not appear, make sure that a student has filled in their first and last name, school and date when they finish high school correctly.

To start a contest, tick the checkboxes of students that are present, and click the start button. This will only be available during the contest dates. If any extra time is given, you must email [nzic@nzoi.org.nz](mailto:nzic@nzoi.org.nz) with the reason within 2 days or else any extra time will be removed.

If a student leaves early, simply click the corresponding checkbox, and stop the contest for them. They will no longer be able to submit solutions.

### Unofficial contestants

In case you are unable to find a suitable time or supervisor, students may register as an unofficial competitor. The results will not be published on this website, but they will appear on the training site.

Just email us at [nzic@nzoi.org.nz](mailto:nzic@nzoi.org.nz) with the following subject line: Unofficial Registration - Username

Please let us know your school and year level.
