## Registration

**Official registration for Round 1 is open!** Please follow the instructions below.

### For Students

Before registering, please create an account on our [training site](https://train.nzoi.org.nz). To compete in the contest, make sure to fill a first and last name, as well as details of your school and expected school graduation date.

At least 1 week before the contest starts, we will set up a practice contest so that you can familiarise yourself with the user interface. The startcode is `practice`.

To check that you have been properly registered, make sure you can see the Start buttons in both the practice and the official contest (grayed out).
