## Registration

Please create an account on our [training site](https://train.nzoi.org.nz). To compete in the contest, make sure to fill a first and last name, as well as details of your school and expected school graduation date.

If you email us at [nzic@nzoi.org.nz](mailto:nzic@nzoi.org.nz), we'll email you a reminder before round one begins. To check that you have been properly registered, make sure you can see the Start button in the official contest (it should be grayed out).
