The NZIC contest series, run by the New Zealand Olympiad in Informatics, will be held again this year. There will be 4 regular rounds held throughout the year. The difficulty ranges from entry-level problems to more challenging problems. To practice, sign up at [https://train.nzoi.org.nz/](https://train.nzoi.org.nz/).

The contest is open to all students currently enrolled in a secondary school (or intermediate) in New Zealand (students from year 7-13). There will be a scoreboard for individuals, and one for schools.

### Scoreboard

The scoreboard for rounds 1 and 2 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16vOMjWpXa0ZvoMRvajdfGyNYAGWaLIPjijcrSdEfE4c/pubhtml).

### Round 1

In 2016, the first round will be Thursday 17th March 17 to Thursday 24th March. Each school may hold the contest anytime within these dates. Official competitors will be supervised and sit it during this time. Unofficial competitors may do this contest in the following week.

### What is Informatics?

In the context of this competition, informatics involves problem solving with computer programs. Problems of a mathematical nature are posed, and students will write a computer program to solve the problem. The competition tests the efficiency and correctness of the algorithms the students come up with. The use of a programming language is not the goal itself, but rather a method by which a solution is expressed.

### What now?

If you are a student, register your interest, and sort out a contest location and time at your school. Find other interested students, and ask a teacher or other adult to supervise (we will allow a parent or school prefect if recommended by a teacher). If you are unable to find a teacher, you may compete unofficially.

If you are a teacher, email us to register your interest. We will let you know of the details required to register students to compete.

Watch this space for updates and more information.

### Results

These will be posted after each round.
