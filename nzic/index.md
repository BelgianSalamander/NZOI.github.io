The NZIC contest series, run by the New Zealand Olympiad in Informatics, will be held again in 2018. There will be 3 regular rounds held throughout the year. The difficulty ranges from entry-level problems to more challenging problems. To practice, sign up at [https://train.nzoi.org.nz/](https://train.nzoi.org.nz/) and look at past NZIC rounds. The contest is held on this train site, and the problems are of a similar format.

The contest is open to all students currently enrolled in a secondary school (or intermediate) in New Zealand (students from year 7-13). There will be a scoreboard for individuals, and one for schools.

### 2018

In 2018, we're retaining the changes that we made in 2017. That means three rounds, no supervision requirement, and a wide range of problem difficulties.

### Dates

The dates for the three rounds will be as follows:

* Round One: Monday 2nd April - Sunday 8th April
* Round Two: Monday 25th June - Sunday 1st July
* Round Three: Monday 13th August - Sunday 19th August (tentative)

Students may log in and start the competition at any point between these dates. Once a student has begun the competition they have three hours to view the problems and submit solutions.

If you're at a school with multiple students wanting to participate you might want to arrange to all sit it at the same time, either after school or during class time (with a teacher's support).

### What is Informatics?

In the context of this competition, informatics involves problem solving with computer programs. Problems of a mathematical nature are posed, and students will write a computer program to solve the problem. The competition tests the efficiency and correctness of the algorithms the students come up with. The use of a programming language is not the goal itself, but rather a method by which a solution is expressed.

### What now?

If you are a student, or a teacher of potentially interested students, email us to register your interest at <nzic@nzoi.org.nz>. We'll email you before the first contest to check you're all registered and set up to participate.
