- Round 2 (Term 2 - Week 4: 23-29 May 2016)
- Round 3 (Term 3 - Week 1: 25-31 July 2016)

Each round will have 4 problems adding up to a score of 400 points, and a duration of 3 hours.

### Official competitors

Each school can pick what time their students will do the contest. That means that as suits the school, the contest can be held during school hours, after-school or on Saturday. Each contest will run from Monday-Sunday of that week (except round 1 because of Easter).

### Unofficial competitors

The unofficial contests will be during the week after the official contest. After registration, the contest will be visible for you. Please do not talk to others about the problems, and compete fairly.
