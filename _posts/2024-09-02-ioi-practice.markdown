The team has arrived in the Arab Academy For Science, Technology & Maritime Transport in Alexandria and has enjoyed a relaxing few days to adjust to the local time zone. After a chance to experience the contest environment in the practice contest, the team headed to Bibliotheca of Alexandria to attend the official ceremony. We wish them the best of luck for Contest 1 tomorrow.
