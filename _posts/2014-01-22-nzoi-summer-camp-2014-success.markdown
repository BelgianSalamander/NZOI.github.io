With over 25 students coming from all over New Zealand, and a grueling 12 hours spent in the Auckland airport waiting for flights, the summer camp has come to a close.

We had students from every walk of life, some competing at the IOI level, for a spot on the team, and others learning C++ as their first or second language

We really want to thank AUT and Grafton Hall, for without them, our camp would not be possible. We also have to thank our generous lecturers and tutors, who give up their time to help educate!

See you all next year!
